wey's energy, but ol his statement that Latin can b'e mede ae alive as
any modern langnage.-Tte Continent (Phila.)

Latine is likely to be a most remarkable work in this country in
waking teechere out ol the ruts, and in stimulating studente to treet ·
Latin as a language thet ie not ariddle like a euicere puzzle. The
variety thot its aditor manages to introduce is quite surprising. We
are glad to know that Latine is meeting with hearty encouragement‚
lor it isacredit to American eoholarship and enterprise.-Pllla. l’rces.
